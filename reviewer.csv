205,"Brain-inspired machine learning is gaining increasing consideration, particularly in computer vision. Several studies investigated the inclusion of top-down feedback connections in convolutional networks; however, their functional role remains unclear. Here, we consider deep convolutional networks and implement Predictive Coding (PC) dynamics through feedback connections to perform object recognition under noisy conditions. Then, we interpret the functional role of the predictive feedback by letting the network optimize the corresponding hyper-parameters in various experimental situations. Across different model depths and architectures (3-layer CNN, ResNet18, and EfficientNetB0) and against various types of noise (CIFAR100-C), we find that the network increasingly relies on top-down predictions as the noise level increases. This effect is most prominent at lower layers in deeper networks. Moreover, the accuracy of the network implementing PC dynamics significantly increases over time-steps, compared to its equivalent feed-forward network. Our results provide novel insights relevant to Neuroscience by confirming the computational role of feedback connections in sensory systems, and to Machine Learning by revealing the benefits of PC dynamics in robust computer vision.

207,"Our brain constantly uses prior knowledge that reflects the statistics of our environment to shape our perception. Those statistics can be implicit, not directly observable but learned from observations, or explicit, communicated directly to the observer, especially in humans. Those different origins and mechanisms for acquiring priors may influence perception differently. Here, we manipulated the strength of priors and sensory likelihood to study perceptual inference in both implicit and explicit contexts. Using Bayesian models of learning and decision, we showed that subjects performed worse in the explicit than implicit context because they neglected more the sensory likelihood. The weight of the likelihood was highly correlated between contexts (but different on average) across individuals, but the weight of priors was unrelated. Those results support a dissociation in perceptual inference between the use of implicit vs. explicit priors. Many previous studies reported suboptimality of perceptual inference in healthy subjects or psychiatric disorders; those results could be reinterpreted in light of the implicit-explicit origin of priors.

210,"In our daily lives, we quickly and effortlessly perceive features of others' interactions. Extracting these social details is crucial for deciding how to act in the social world, but little is understood about how this is solved in the mind and brain. Recent work has identified a visually-selective region for the presence of a social interaction in posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS), but whether and how diverse features of a social interaction (ranging from visual to high-level) are presented in the pSTS or elsewhere in the brain is unknown. To answer this question, we showed participants 250 3-second video clips of naturalistic two-person interactions while undergoing fMRI. We used an encoding model approach to model where visual and social features of the videos are represented in the brain. We replicate known preference for scene and object features in visual cortex. We also find preference for facing bodies in EBA and joint action in pSTS, extending prior findings with controlled stimuli to natural settings. Finally, we identify regions along the extent of the STS that show a preference for third-party communication. Together, these results suggest a hierarchy of visual to social feature processing along the lateral surface of the brain."

211,"Predicting what will come next in a changing and stochastic world is difficult. However, humans are able to do so based on past observations in a reasonably accurate manner by following the principles of Bayesian inference. In particular, they have a sense of confidence about their predictions and use it to regulate the updates of those predictions. Here, we probed the neural representation of this confidence in human adults during a probability-learning task with 7T fMRI. Participants were shown binary sequences of visual stimuli generated from an abruptly changing Bernoulli process. They covertly estimated the latent item probability and occasionally reported it along with their estimation confidence. We modelled learning with an (Bayesian) ideal model and distinguished prediction (the probability estimate), confidence (the estimate's precision), predictability, and surprise. Participants' reports correlated with those of the ideal observer. Our results unveiled a neural representation of confidence in a fronto-parietal network where the fMRI activity was 1) sensitive to confidence, 2) specifically so with respect to confounds (surprise and predictability), 3) invariant to which item is predicted in the sequence, and 4) functional inasmuch as it overlapped with a representation of surprise (relevant for confidence-weighted updates), and predicted the subjective confidence reports."
212,"The visual processing stream is capable of both inferring object identity under changes of viewing conditions, and of using object knowledge to fill in for missing sensory information. Current models of invariant recognition process information in a feedforward manner, leaving the question open how the top-down pathway is trained. Here, we show that predictive coding networks as a model of generative perception acquire object representations invariant to rotational angle, scale and lateral position when trained on sequences of continuously moving objects. The network reconstructs whole images from partially occluded inputs akin to observed decodability of occluded scene information in human early visual areas, which can only be addressed by models with information-carrying recurrent connections. Furthermore, the resulting dynamics of error-encoding neurons in the model provide a novel angle for experimental research on neural encoding of prediction errors."

214,"Transient goals are key motivators in human learning. Extending the classic reinforcement learning framework to include a flexible mapping of outcomes to rewards according to current goals accounts for goals as intrinsic reinforcers. However, learning by encoding transient goals as rewards is slower than learning with familiar rewards. Here, we test whether this effect is due to occasional lapses in goal encoding and the subsequent value updating. We tasked human participants with learning from both familiar rewards (the ""Points"" condition) and abstract novel ""goal"" images (the ""Goals"" condition). To detect lapses in goal encoding, we asked participants to report all positive outcomes they received. Behavioral results replicated our previous finding that people learn less efficiently when they encode goals as rewards than directly receiving familiar rewards. However, our modeling analysis suggested that lapses could not fully explain this behavioral discrepancy. This finding challenges the hypothesis that lapses are the primary cause of slower goal-driven learning, providing insights into the complex cognitive mechanisms of how humans learn from flexible, goal-dependent value assignments."
215,"Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven a valuable model of the inferior temporal cortex (IT) of the human brain. One seductive explanation is that CNNs and IT have learned similar category-specific image features (henceforth semantic features). However, a recent study found that an untrained neural network with random weights modelled IT just as well as trained networks. This might be because the architecture alone of CNNs causes them to effectively extract basic perceptual features, which are also known to be represented in IT. Alternatively, untrained and trained networks may capture different aspects of IT representation - perceptual and semantic features, respectively. Here we test this hypothesis using mediation models with perceptual and semantic mediators. We find that different networks, and different layers in the same network, capture distinct features of the representation in IT, highlighting the risk of solely using a superficial similarity metric when the aim is to achieve a deeper understanding of representations in the brain and CNNs."
216,"Convolutional neural networks exhibit organizational principles of early visual areas. However, they still lack several important characteristics such as cortical magnification, eccentricity-dependence of receptive field sizes and spatial frequency tuning, as well as radial bias. We suggest that these properties arise from the non-uniform sampling of external space that results from the distribution of ganglion cells in the retina. To test this conjecture, we introduce the retinal sampling layer (RSL) which resamples images according to retinal ganglion cell density, before feeding them into the CORnet-Z architecture. Training the network on natural images resulted in it developing all of the hypothesized characteristics."

222,"Bayesian hierarchical models are well-suited to analyzing the often noisy data from electroencephalography experiments in cognitive neuroscience: these models provide an intuitive framework to account for structures and correlations in the data, and they allow a straightforward handling of uncertainty. In a typical neurolinguistic experiment, event-related potentials show only very small effect sizes and frequentist approaches to data analysis fail to establish the significance of some of these effects. Here, we present a Bayesian approach to analyzing event-related potentials using as an example data from an experiment which relates word surprisal and neural response. Our model is able to estimate the effect of word surprisal on most components of the event-related potential and provides a richer description of the data. The Bayesian framework also allows easier comparison between estimates based on surprisal values calculated using different language models."

225,"Although we do not always measure time, we can estimate the passage of time based on our previous experience. However, it is unclear how the brain estimates the passage of time without explicit measures. We hypothesized that people use situational information to compensate for missing time. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we aimed to probe how our brain estimates time with/without situational information. As a result, the frontal lobe is actively involved in time estimation with situational information. The cerebellum and hippocampus were significantly activated in estimating time without situational information. We suggest that the frontal lobe plays a vital role in time estimation to control attentional modulation and time-based prospective memory with situational information. In contrast, the cerebellum and the hippocampus seem to act as an internal clock since these regions were involved in the relatively pure estimation of the time."
226,"Humans and other animals often infer spurious associations among unrelated events. However, such superstitious learning is usually accounted for by conditioned associations, raising the question of whether an animal could develop more complex cognitive structures independent of reinforcement. Here, we tasked monkeys with discovering the serial order of two pictorial sets: a ""learnable"" set in which the stimuli were implicitly ordered and monkeys were rewarded for choosing the higher-rank stimulus and an ""unlearnable"" set in which stimuli were unordered and feedback was random regardless of the choice. We replicated prior results that monkeys reliably learned the implicit order of the learnable set. Surprisingly, the monkeys behaved as though some ordering also existed in the unlearnable set, showing consistent choice preference even under a preference-discouraging reward schedule that gave rewards more frequently to the stimulus that was selected less often. In simulations, a model-free RL algorithm (Q-learning) displayed a degree of consistent ordering among the unlearnable set but, unlike the monkeys, failed to do so under the preference-discouraging reward schedule. Our results suggest that monkeys infer abstract structures from objectively random events using heuristics that extend beyond stimulus-outcome conditional learning to more cognitive model-based learning mechanisms."
232,"fMRI enables non-invasive neuroimaging with high spatial resolution, but analyzing fMRI's hemodynamic data is challenging due to its complex relationship to the underlying neural activity. Deep learning's power to find non-linear relationships makes it particularly suitable for fMRI analyses, with many successful applications in classification of resting-state data. However, few have explored deep learning's potential to generate continuous cross-modal predictions. If deep learning can translate fMRI data to neurophysiological EEG, it could become a promising method for uncovering relationships between hemodynamic changes and neural activity. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept that deep recurrent neural networks can predict sleep EEG delta power from resting-state fMRI on a datapoint-to-datapoint basis, even for out-of-sample subjects, with predictions primarily driven by cortical fMRI dynamics. Supporting the idea that these predictions leverage non-linear information, a cross-correlation analysis revealed that our model outperformed simple linear methods. These results highlight the potential of deep learning to identify complex relationships between hemodynamic fMRI and EEG neural activity that cannot be detected with traditional linear analyses."
233,"Rapid network reconfigurations within the brain are essential to our ability to effortlessly act within a complex and dynamic environment. The field of network neuroscience has attempted to capture and estimate these changes within the brain and has proven successful in linking a large variety of behaviors to these dynamics. One of the most successful of these efforts has been in the development and deployment of dynamic community structure detection. However, there still exists a substantial challenge in deploying this (and others) method to data that is highly variable in spatial and temporal resolution of measuring brain dynamics in addition to the inherent elastic nature of the brain. This tutorial will introduce a Python implementation of the generalized Louvain in a dynamic form that optimizes the elasticity of the measurement technique in its implementation. In this tutorial, we will deploy dynamic community detection pipelines within a theoretically driven context of parameter search, and we end the tutorial with an overview of the metrics possible in analysis of brain dynamics derived after distilling the dynamic functional connectivity matrices into discrete network reconfigurations."
234,"A complete neuroscience requires multi-level theories that address phenomena ranging from higher-level cognitive behaviors to activities within a cell. Unfortunately, we don't have cognitive models of behavior whose components can be decomposed into the neural dynamics that give rise to behavior, leaving an explanatory gap. Inspired by algorithms that capture flocking behavior in birds, we introduce a neural flocking learning rule to coordinates units that collectively form higher-level mental constructs and parallels recurrent hippocampal activity. The decomposed model shows how brain-scale neural populations coordinate to form assemblies encoding concept and spatial representations, and why many neurons are required for robust performance. Our account provides a multi-level explanation for how cognition and symbol-like representations are supported by coordinated neural assemblies formed through learning."

Here, we leverage time-generalized decoding from MEG brain source activations to show that listened and imagined melodies are represented in auditory cortex, thalamus and middle cingulate cortex. Accuracy patterns reveal that during listening and imagining sounds are represented as a melodic group, while during listening they are also represented individually. Opposite brain activation patterns distinguish between melodies during listening compared to imagining. Our work sheds light on the representational dynamics of listened and imagined musical sound sequences."

246,"Representational similarity analysis is a versatile method for comparing high dimensional models and neural recording data to each other. Here, we introduce a comprehensive new set of methods for statistical model comparison based on predictions of representational geometries. The inference can handle flexible parametrized models and can treat both subjects and conditions as random effects, such that conclusions generalize to the respective populations of subjects and conditions. With crossvalidated representational distance estimators and metric whitened model evaluators, the power for model comparisons approximates that of likelihood-based inference, but rank-based model evaluation is also supported. We validate the inference methods using extensive simulations with deep neural networks and resampling of calcium imaging and functional MRI data. Results demonstrate that the methods are valid and conclusions generalize correctly. These data analysis methods are available in an open-source Python toolbox."

249,"Predictive coding is a leading theoretical framework for understanding sensory processing as statistical inference. Its main tenet is that sensory input is analysed by prediction error units: neural processors that test our internal expectations on the sensory world against the sensory input. Prediction error units encode the difference between the expectations and the actual input, which is used in higher levels of the processing hierarchy to inform updates in our internal beliefs. The encoding of additive prediction error, signals that aim to add unaccounted elements to the internal representations, has been extensively studied before, both in sensory cortices and the subcortical sensory pathways. Whether sensory pathways also encode subtractive prediction error, signals that aim to remove representations of expected percepts that were absent in the sensory input, has not been unambiguously considered before. Here we used human fMRI to measure responses to omissions of sounds for which participants held varying levels of expectations. We used modelling and Bayesian model comparison to compute the posterior probability that neural populations in auditory midbrain and thalamus specifically encoded subtractive prediction error. The results provide first evidence of the encoding of subtractive prediction error in a subcortical sensory pathway, demonstrating that subcortical nuclei partake on the removal of wrong beliefs in high-level cognitive representations."
